👋 **Hi, I am Radhika Kumar.**

An Electrical Engineer by qualification, I have worked in Manufacturing and Education sector. Realising my passion for technology in finding creative solutions, I have developed great interest to analyse data and write codes in Python language. 
Returning from a brief career break, I am excited to start my journey as a woman returner in tech.👩🏻‍💻

👀 I have been learning various tools like MySQL, Python, Tableau and Power BI from great sources such as Udacity, CFG, PA consulting, FreeCodeCamp etc.

Below are few of my project codes in the Github repo.

**Python:** https://github.com/RadhikaK14/Python-Course.git

PA consulting Python projects:

1. Guess_the_word (Hangman game) - Final_project.py
2. Calendar Generator - mini_project.py
3. Rock_Paper_Scissor game - mini_project.py

**MySQL**: https://github.com/RadhikaK14/SQL_Project_MovieDB.git
